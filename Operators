⭐The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
Assignment Examples
let x = 10;
// Assign the value 5 to x
let x = 5;
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2;
// Assign the value x + y to z:
let z = x + y;


⭐The Addition Operator (+) adds numbers:
Adding
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;

⭐The Multiplication Operator (*) multiplies numbers.
Multiplying
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;

⭐There are different types of JavaScript operators:
Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
Conditional Operators
Type Operators

⭐Arithmetic Operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:
Arthmetic Operators Example
let a = 3;
let x = (100 + 50) * a;

+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation 
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

⭐The Addition Assignment Operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.
let x = 10;
x += 5;

⭐Operator	Example	Same As
=	x = y	x = y
+=	x += y	x = x + y
-=	x -= y	x = x - y
*=	x *= y	x = x * y
/=	x /= y	x = x / y
%=	x %= y	x = x % y
**=	x **= y	x = x ** y

⭐Example 
let text1 = "John";
let text2 = "Doe";
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;
The result of text3 will be:

John Doe

⭐Example
let text1 = "What a very ";
text1 += "nice day";
The result of text1 will be:

What a very nice day
